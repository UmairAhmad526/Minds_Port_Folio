I started by creating a repository on GitHub to store my project. To link the repository with my local machine, I used the git clone command to copy the repositoryâ€™s data. Whenever I made changes to the code, I used git add . to stage all the changes and git commit -m "message" to commit those changes locally. Once I was ready to upload my updates, I used the git push command to push my changes to the remote repository on my branch. This workflow allowed me to efficiently manage and synchronize my code between GitHub and my local machine.
